How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    You can see the evolution of your code and find differences allong the time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    I think is better the manual saving because you can have a better history 
    version. In the other hand, automatic saves could prevent loosing important
    parts when you forget doing manual savig.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because Git is for software developing and Google Docs was thougth to be used
    with documents.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    You use the command git log to see the different id commits. After this, you
    can use the command git diff id1 id2, to see de changes between the two versions

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    When you make any change it is recorded in the history log, and you can reverse
    whenever you want.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    To control the different versions of my onw programs.
